## Why

The Congress has a total of 535 members. It's hard to keep up to date on your representatives as well as the bills they are introducing and voting on. This app aims to put that information readily available to ensure your representatives are held accountable!

## Features

- [x] **Search**: Users can view search for representatives by state, or by searching for their name
- [x] **Missed Votes Leaderboard**: Users can see which representatives have missed the most amount of votes in the congress (hold them accountable!)
- [x] **Recent Bills**: Users can view the latest bills that are currently being introduced and considered on the Congress floor!
- [x] **Committees**: Users can view the all of the committees that exist in Congress as well as see who is the Chairman of each
- [x] **Compare Members**: Users can compare two different members of Congress with a side by side view
- [x] **Follow Members**: Users can follow different members of Congress to be able to see their information for easy access on their dashboard

### Next Features

- [ ] **Better comparisons**: Be able to compare two members of congress on more data, ideally on issues as well
- [ ] **Profile Social Media**: Better social media integration, being able to follow twitter, youtube, facebook straight from the profile page, as well as feeds
- [ ] **Follow Bills**: As a user, be able to follow bills in order to keep up to date when they are updated
